                            It is a React Hook that allows you to cache a function definition between re-renders.

                        <li>
                            Itâ€™s particularly useful when dealing with functions that are passed as props or used within other hooks. By memoizing the function, you can prevent unnecessary re-creations and optimize performance.

                        <h5>Problem It Solves:</h5>
                        <li><b>Unnecessary Re-renders:</b> When you pass a callback function as a prop to a child component, React creates a new function instance on every render (even if its logic hasn't changed). This can lead to unnecessary child component re-renders, affecting performance.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Referential Identity and Equality Checks:</b> React compares components during diffing using referential equality (strict comparison of object references). If you create a new callback function on every render, even if its contents are identical, React will consider it a different function and trigger a re-render of the child component. useCallback helps avoid this by ensuring the same function reference is passed down if its dependencies haven't changed.
